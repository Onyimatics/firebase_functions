# firebase_functions
Leverage Firebase Functions in order to persist the user details in the Realtime Database.

## Getting started
There is no need to set up or scale a server, we will just write the functions and deploy them to Firebase. They will be triggered only when the requests are called.

At this very moment, Google Cloud Functions can be written in Node.js (v6 or v8), Python (beta) or Go (beta). I will proceed further with Node.js and some additional resources such as Express and CORS.
